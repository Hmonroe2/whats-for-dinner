## Introduction
  - The purpose of this project was to allow students to gain experience with the fundamental concepts of creating an application. We wrote HTML and CSS to match a Comp.
  We wrote DRY javascript in-order to add functionality to our application. We learned to listen and use user events. This project gave us the ability to individualize our skill set with unique extensions.
## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Features
- Any of the radio buttons chosen will output a specific item from that array.
- The Choose Your Own Adventure I chose was the “Entire Meal Functionality”. Each button will output random items (side, main dish, dessert) OR one of each for a meal idea for any user clicking the buttons.
## Deployed Page

## Possible Future Extensions
  - A login page, if it were responsive in a sense of allowing users login to be saved/recipe ideas they like to be stored within their page.
  - Adding in transitions via CSS would have appreciated.
